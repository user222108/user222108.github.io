        <h3>ESTONIA &amp; THAILAND: HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP</h3>
        <div class="prose">
          <p>
            Thailand, officially the Kingdom of Thailand, formerly known as Siam. Siam was first mentioned in Estonian writings in professor M. von Engelhardt’s short geographical piece in 1824. In 1849, Thailand (then known as Siam) and its capital Bangkok were mentioned in Berend Gildermann’s textbook. The first reports about Thailand (Siam) appeared in “Perno Postimees” in 1857.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siam, as a founding member of the League of Nations, recognized the Republic of Estonia when it joined that organization on 22 October 1921. The Kingdom of Thailand re-recognized the Republic of Estonia on 9 September 1991.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diplomatic relations between the two states were re-established on 27 April 1992.
